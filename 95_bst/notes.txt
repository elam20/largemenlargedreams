With L = level, d = depth, h = heightâ€¦

1. a perfect binary tree has (2^(L+1))-1 nodes
2. at each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^(d-1) nodes
3. height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is log_2(n-1)

DISCO:
  Traversals are very easy in recursive format

QCC:
  Level? Depth? Height? So confusing...
