Q.
1. What happens when the deck runs out of cards and the timer didn't end?

2. What happens when both teams didn't get the same amount of runs?  

3. What is a swing component?      
A.
1. When the deck runs out of cards and the timer didn't end, we pause the timer and take the time to reshuffle the deck with all the cards to completely play out the turn.

2. When the teams didn't get the same amount of runs, we would set a counter for each team to have the same number of runs or attempts.

3. The swing component is the basic building blocks of an application that could be interactable with the user themselves.  

CC. The cards (celebrities) used for one round won't be repeated for future rounds. (Drawn from Pile at Random)

*  Experience: The set up was very straightforward, similar to other works of code. The to do list made sure that we were striking through all the points and that we would get our work done. Working with the GUI interface for Activity 3, following into the
	Activity 4 was very difficult.
