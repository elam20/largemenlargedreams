DISCO
Leading zeros are problematic in short and int data types. Why? Who knows.
Used strings instead to fix this problem.
Gained clarity on constructors and an apparent default constructor in java.
Remembered how to type cast from the summer homework.
Remembered how to code in minor steps and how to code smartly.
Q1-4 are on piazza. Lucky us.
---------------------------------------------
QCC
A few minor discrepancies:
1) Why double? You aren't converting currencies or anything. Float precision should be fine.
2) How to resolve leading zero(s) problem? string formatting like python or a method to that same purpose.
3) The template at
https://github.com/ap251/closet/blob/main/18_BankAccount/BankAccount.java
has the mutator methods set up to return values. This betrays the definition of a mutator
method. Unless a mutator method can change a variable and also return that variable.
However, would it return the old or new value of said variable?
4) Short or int for pin and acctNum? These variables can still be of use as strings, and
arguably of better use. Problems were encountered when dealing with leading zeros.
5)
gentleman.setBalance((float)0.00);//sets bal to 0.00 units of currency
System.out.println("account bal: " + gentleman.bal);
The above prints "0.0", despite the specified precision of two decimal places. Maybe this has to
do with the precision of the print method. This could mean that there is
another print method that specifies the precision of numerical values.
---------------------------------------------
Q2) This is evidenced when initializing integer variables. We do not use
the new constructor. Java just does it's thing there.
Q3) You can run
System.out.print((String)<object name>);
in the main method of a java file. The data type of the object should not be
string and be different than string. If there is an error, then you will discover
that you cannot do such. If there is not an error, then you will discover
that you can do such.

    //based on this, we can conclude that leading zeros in short cause the input to be processed differently
    //How to get around this?
    //Some sort of try catch structure. If there is/are (a) leading zero/zeros, do foo
    //We will use Strings for now to get around this leading zero problem. Maybe later
    //we can follow up on this and implement it proprerly.
    //Similar logic can be applied to check the length of the input. if the given length
    is not equal to the required length, do foo
    The same kind of logic applies to the withdraw and deposit methods. Right now, the
    input of these methods can be positive or negative, even though that
    doesn't make sense. The bank doesn't give you money when you deposit money,
    and vice versa.
