>Code should be incremental so you know where errors are
>Only the first error message is truly reliable
>It tells you where the compiler noticed the problem, not where it is.
>Make sure you're editing and compiling the same code
>Debugging by bisection- delete half the code to determine where the error is
>Don't always listen to the compiler
>Solve hanging (infinite loops or recursion) by putting a print statement before and after loops.
>The same can be done with methods.
>Infinite recursion will return a stack overflow error.
>Exception message errors display the line, name of exception, and a stack trace
>Simplify the output
>Develop a hypothesis and test it for logic errors
>Break down complex expressions into a series of assignments and temporary variables.
>Rubber duck debugging
