HW99: Some Are More Equal Than Others, Codified
2022-05-13
time spent: 1hr + class time

DISCO:
Priority Queues have to be enqueued in the order they are enqueued. You can only decide on priority when removing/peeking. This makes the code slow. But this has to be.
I do not like it.
I cry.

On a side note, comment more in code. Not like I didn't. 

QCC:
How can we use int in our code for Array Priority Queue? Is the cargo the priority?
What is the best way to establish priority in the list? Index? Label? Else?
